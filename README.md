# ScrumBut

ScrumBut is a web app that adds [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum/) features to GitHub Issues.

Despite Scrum’s focus on synchronous, co-located sprint meetings, ScrumBut will try to support asynchronous, distributed workflows as much as possible, to make it easy for remote workers to collaborate as well. This is why the project’s name comes from a [derogatory term](https://www.scrum.org/ScrumBut) referring to teams that don’t use “true Scrum.”

## Deployment

Although there are many possible ways to deploy ScrumBut, the only _supported_ method is the [Haskell on Heroku](https://haskellonheroku.com) buildpack. Please see the [Haskell on Heroku tutorial](https://haskellonheroku.com/tutorial/) to learn how you can deploy your own copy.
