# ScrumBut

ScrumBut is a web app that adds [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum/) features to GitHub Issues.

Despite Scrum’s focus on synchronous, co-located sprint meetings, ScrumBut will try to support asynchronous, distributed workflows as much as possible, to make it easy for remote workers to collaborate as well. This is why the project’s name comes from a [derogatory term](https://www.scrum.org/ScrumBut) referring to teams that don’t use “true Scrum.”
